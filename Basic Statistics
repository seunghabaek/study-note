 ## Basic Statistics
 # Cases, variables and levels of measurement

  - variables : characteristics of something or someone (ex. characteristics of players)
 
  - cases : something or someone (ex. players themselves)
  
  - levels of measurement
  	
  	Categorical
  		- nominal : difference
  		- ordinal : difference + order

  	Quantitative
  		- interval : difference + order + similar intervals
  		- ratio : difference + order + similar intervals + meaningful zero point

  		- discrete : set of separate numbers
  		- continuous : infinite region of values


 # Data matrix and frequency table

  - data matrix shows all datas so, it contains too many things.
  - frequency table is something like summarized table of data matrix.
  	-> shows how the valuse are distributed over the cases
  	-> if you recoded quantitive table to ordinal categories table, you can get the concise valus but lose the details of datas.


 # Graphs and shapes od distributions

  - pie chart : immediately see percentage (nominal, ordinal)
  - bar graph
  	-> easily retrive exact number
  	-> has advantage when if comes to dealing with high number of categories
  - dot plot : using with nominal values
  - histogram : bars to portray the frequencies of the possible values of a variable (interval, ratio)


 # Mode, median and mean

 - mode : value that occurs most frequently. <- categorical
 - median : the middle value. <- quantitative & influential outliers/skewed
 - mean : the sum of all the values divided by the number of ovservations <- quantitative


 # Range, interquartile range and box plot

 - range : highest value - lowest value
 
 - interquartile range 
 	- leaves out the extreme values
 	- distribution in four equal parts
 	- divided into 4 ranges equally
 	- q1, q2, q3
 		- q1 : first 25% of all
 		- q2 : mean
 		- q3 : last 25% of all
 		- IQR : q3 - q1

 - box plot : graph to describe center, variability and outliers


 # Variance and standard deviation

 - variance(S^2) = sum of (x- x bar)^2 divided by (sample size-1) 
 - standard deviation(S) = root of variance
 -
